=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use the services of Let's Encrypt to generate SSL certificates.
Use the F<acmefetch.cfg> file to specify what should be done.

If a key or cert file gets replaced, the old version is renamed to end
with a timestamp of its last modification date.

=head1 CERT NOTES

If you omit the chainOutput and chainFormat keys in your config, key and chain get written to the file you specify in certOutput. Cert first, then chain. E.g. the way nginx expects it.

=head1 APACHE NOTES

The ACME protocol requires remote access files stored in your website to verify
that you have control over the website. Since the website may have special ideas about
how it wants to control file access. Some special F<.htaccess> rules may come in handy.
